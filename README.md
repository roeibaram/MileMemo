# MileMemo ✈️

MileMemo is a personal flight journal that lets users search for flights, save
trips they’ve taken, and track the total distance they’ve flown over time.

## Why MileMemo

Many travel apps focus on booking and prices. MileMemo focuses on memory and
history — helping users keep a personal record of their flights and see how far
they’ve traveled throughout their life.

## Core Features

- Search flights by origin, destination, and date
- View scheduled flight details (airline, flight number, times)
- Save flights to a personal trip history
- Track total miles flown across all saved flights
- Data persists locally using browser storage

## Tech Stack

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Aviationstack API (final API decision still in progress)
- LocalStorage
